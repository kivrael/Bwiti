This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a single-page website for a Bwiti Spiritual Center called "Sacred Forest", showcasing their ceremonies, traditions, and contact information.

## Key Features
- Bilingual (English/French) language switcher
- Responsive design with smooth scrolling
- Intersection Observer for scroll-based animations
- Static HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript

## Development Considerations
- The site is a pure static HTML page with inline styles and scripts
- No build process or external dependencies required
- Modify directly in the index.html file

## Deployment
- Can be hosted on any static site hosting service
- No compilation or build steps needed
